## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)

This repository contains code for analyzing Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data from the PRONIA project along with a simulated dataset that might help navigate the main analysis steps.

The main objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between brain structure, psychosis risk and disorder. Specifically, the analyses aim to:

- Examine group effects on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) variables.
- Compare DWI  measures across different clinical groups.
- Investigate associations with clinical and risk phenotypes.

2. [Installation](#installation)

Make sure to have the following R packages installed using install.packages('package_name'):
gtsummary, tidyverse, ggsci, broom, tidyr, ggbeeswarm, kableExtra, car, AICcmodavg, lubridate, emmeans, data4PCCAR, MASS, CCA, grid, rstatix, psych, corrplot, ggcorrplot, cowplot, DT
