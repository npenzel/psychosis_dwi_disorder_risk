## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)

This repository contains code for analyzing Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data from the PRONIA project along with a simulated dataset that might help navigate the main analysis steps.

The main objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between brain structure, psychosis risk and disorder. Specifically, the analyses aim to:

- Examine group effects on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) variables.
- Compare DWI  measures across different clinical groups.
- Investigate associations with clinical and risk phenotypes.

2. [Installation](#installation)

Make sure to have the following R packages installed using install.packages('package_name'):
gtsummary, tidyverse, ggsci, broom, tidyr, ggbeeswarm, kableExtra, car, AICcmodavg, lubridate, emmeans, data4PCCAR, MASS, CCA, grid, rstatix, psych, corrplot, ggcorrplot, cowplot, DT

## Installation

To install **psychosis_dwi_disorder_risk**, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/npenzel/psychosis_dwi_disorder_risk

# Navigate to the project directory
cd psychosis_dwi_disorder_risk

## How to work with the scripts
make sure that you set the working directory to where you have saved **psychosis_dwi_disorder_risk** (setwd()).

- 2 html files show the results of the actual publication: 1.) pronia_psychosis_risk_dwi_paper.html, 2.) pronia_psychosis_cv_results_paper.html.

- Both have an accompanying html file along with the .Rmd file that was used to create them: 1.) pronia_psychosis risk_dwi_simulation.html/.Rmd and 2.) pronia_psychosis_cv_results_simulation.html/.Rmd. These two scripts and html files can be used to follow the analyses step by step.

- The script pronia_psychosis_risk_dwi_crossvalidate_simulation.R showcases on the simulated data all steps of the cross validation. 

- Additionally, there are several functions saved used for the CCA analysis and the tests of robustness, feature importance etc. (bootstrap_cca_function.R, cca_function.R, center_function.R, permute_cca_function.R, permute_dataset.R)

- In the folder cv_function you can find all scripts that were used in the cross-validation of the CCA analysis as called by the script pronia_psychosis_risk_dwi_crossvalidate_simulation.R

- In the folder simulated_data, you can find the simulated data for this study, the permutation indexes created with permute_dataset.R and intermediate results.
